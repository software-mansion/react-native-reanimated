It is required that your code is put inside component as we rely on componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount callbacks to install and cleanup animated nodes. Note that the code you put is going to be executed only once. We currently have no way of telling if your code changes and so it will only be run in componentDidMount. If you wish for your reanimated nodes to be updated when the component updates, you can update the key property of the Animated.Code component, which will effectively unmount the old and mount the new versions of it in the React tree.
