expose native properties that we want to animate.\nIn such a case we want to avoid roundtrips to the main JavaScript thread in order to update such properties while animating.\nThankfully, Reanimated allows for that, but as the properties do not belong to styles we can't just use the ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedStyle"})," hook.\nFor this purpose Reanimated exposes a separate hook called ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedProps"}),".\nIt works in a very similar way to ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedStyle"})," but instead of expecting a method that returns the animated styles, we expect the returned object to contain properties that we want to animate.\nThen, in order to hook animated props to a view, we provide the resulting object as ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"animatedProps"}),' property to the "Animated" version of the view type we want to render (e.g. ',(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Animated.View"}),").\nPlease check the documentation of the ",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"/docs/2.x/api/hooks/useAnimatedProps",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedProps"})})," hook for usage examples."]})]})}function
