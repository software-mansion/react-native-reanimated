and cause significant delays despite being run on the native threads.\nAn example where the layout property update can be expensive is a change of ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"flex-direction"})," on a container with many items.\nSuch a change will cause each of the items to reposition and also change their dimensions.\nThe change of the dimensions for each of the views may trigger further layout recalculations of the nested views down to the leaf nodes.\nAs you can see, a single property change can trigger a lot of recomputation.\nIt may perform just fine when we need to fire it once, but if we decided to run such computation during animation for every frame, the outcome may not be satisfactory especially on low-end devices.\nAs we work to improve performance of complex layout updates in Reanimated 2, when you experience issues that are the effects of heavy layout computation on every frame, we recommend that you try Reanimated's ",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"/docs/1.x/transitions",children:"Transition API"})," or React Native's ",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://reactnative.dev/docs/layoutanimation",children:"LayoutAnimation API"}),"."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"animating-non-style-properties",children:"Animating Non-Style Properties"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["View styles are definitely the most frequently animated properties out there.\nHowever, in some use cases it is important to also animate properties that do not belong to styles.\nThis is especially important if we have native components that expose native properties that we want to animate.\nIn such a case we want to avoid roundtrips to the main JavaScript thread in order to update such properties while animating.\nThankfully, Reanimated allows for that, but as the properties do not belong to styles we can't just use the ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedStyle"})," hook.\nFor this purpose Reanimated exposes a separate hook called ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedProps"}),".\nIt works in a very similar way to ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedStyle"})," but instead of expecting a method that returns the animated styles, we expect the returned object to contain properties that we want to animate.\nThen, in order to hook animated props to a view, we provide the resulting object as ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"animatedProps"}),' property to the "Animated" version of the view type we want to render (e.g. ',(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Animated.View"}),").\nPlease check the documentation of the ",(0,a.jsx)(n.a,{href:"/docs/2.x/api/hooks/useAnimatedProps",children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"useAnimatedProps"})})," hook for usage examples."]})]})}function
