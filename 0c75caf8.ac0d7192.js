Layout Properties"),Object(o.b)("p",null,"Reanimated makes it possible for animations to be executed by completely avoiding the main React Native's JavaScript thread.\nThanks to the animation runner being completely isolated, the application logic (rendering components, fetching and processing data, etc) cannot impact the performance of animation and hence allows to avoid many unpredictable frame drops.\nDevelopers who are familiar with React Native's ",Object(o.b)("a",Object(a.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated"}),"Animated API")," and the concept of ",Object(o.b)("a",Object(a.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"https://reactnative.dev/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated"}),"Native Driver")," may already understand this benefit, and also know that the use of Native Driver is limited to some subset of view properties.\nThis, however, is not the case in Reanimated which supports animations of ",Object(o.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"all")," native properties without generating any load on the main JavaScript thread (including layout properties like ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"width"),", ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"flex"),", etc.).\nThis, in fact, was already the case since the first version of Reanimated but we'd like to emphasize that again as we receive questions around this topic from time to time."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"When discussing animated updates of layout properties, however, it is important to note that even though we avoid calling into the main JavaScript thread, some of the layout updates can be really expensive and cause significant delays despite being run on the native threads.\nAn example where the layout property update can be expensive is a change of ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"flex-direction")," on a container with many items.\nSuch a change will cause each of the items to reposition and also change their dimensions.\nThe change of the dimensions for each of the views may trigger further layout recalculations of the nested views down to the leaf nodes.\nAs you can see, a single property change can trigger a lot of recomputation.\nIt may perform just fine when we need to fire it once, but if we decided to run such computation during animation for every frame, the outcome may not be satisfactory especially on low-end devices.\nAs we work to improve performance of complex layout updates in Reanimated 2, when you experience  issues that are the effects of heavy layout computation on every frame, we recommend that you try Reanimated's ",Object(o.b)("a",Object(a.a)({parentName:"p"},{href:"/react-native-reanimated/docs/1.x.x/transitions"}),"Transition API")," or React Native's

Non-Style Properties"),Object(o.b)("p",null,"View styles are definitely the most frequently animated properties out there.\nHowever, in some usecases it is important to also animate properties that do not belong to styles.\nThis is especially important if we have native components that expose native properties that we want to animate.\nIn such a case we want to avoid roundtrips to the main JavaScript thread in order to update such properties while animating.\nThankfully, Reanimated allows for that, but as the properties do not belong to styles we can't just use the ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"useAnimatedStyle")," hook.\nFor this purpose Reanimated exposes a separate hook called ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"useAnimatedProps"),".\nIt works in a very similar way to ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"useAnimatedStyle")," but instead of expecting a method that returns the animated styles, we expect the returned object to contain properties that we want to animate.\nThen, in order to hook animated props to a view, we provide the resulting object as ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"animatedProps"),' property to the "Animated" version of the view type we want to render (e.g. ',Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Animated.View"),").\nPlease check the documentation of
