# makeShareable

<DeprecatedBanner />

`makeShareable` lets you create a `Shareable` object from a given value on the UI thread.
Any modifications made to this shared object on the UI thread will be automatically visible to all worklets on the UI thread.


## Reference

```javascript
import { makeShareable, executeOnUIRuntimeSync } from 'react-native-worklets';

const shareable = makeShareable({
    count: 0,
});

executeOnUIRuntimeSync(() => {
    console.log(shareable.count); // 0
})();

executeOnUIRuntimeSync(() => {
    shareable.count = 1;
})();

executeOnUIRuntimeSync(() => {
    console.log(shareable.count); // 1
})();
```
