# Glossary of terms

## Worklet

Worklets are short-running JavaScript functions that can be run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread). They can also be run on a JavaScript thread just as you would run a function in your code.

Most of the time when working with Reanimated the code is automatically [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) and run on the UI thread by default.

```javascript
const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
  console.log('Running on the UI thread');
  return { opacity: 0.5 };
});
```

You can create your own worklets using the `"worklet";` directive at the top of a function.

```javascript
function myWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log('Running on the UI thread');
}
```

[`runOnUI`](/docs/threading/runOnUI) lets you manually run worklets on the UI thread:

```javascript
function myWorklet(greeting) {
  'worklet';
  console.log(`${greeting} from the UI thread`);
}

function onPress() {
  // highlight-next-line
  runOnUI(myWorklet)('Howdy');
}
```

## to workletize

To convert a JavaScript function into a serializable object which can be copied and run over on [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

Functions marked with `"worklet";` directive are automatically picked up and workletized by the Reanimated Babel plugin.

## Worklet Runtime

A JavaScript runtime spawned by `react-native-worklets`. It's pre-configured to be able to execute worklets.

It isn't coupled to any thread, but there might be a thread dedicated to its execution.

You can learn more about different runtime types by reading the [Runtime kinds](/docs/fundamentals/runtimeKinds) section.

## UI Runtime

A unique [Worklet Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#worklet-runtime) that is tailored to efficiently offload work from the [RN Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#react-native-runtime-rn-runtime) and to allow for synchronous access to native events and the native rendering layer.

## React Native Runtime (RN Runtime)

A JavaScript runtime that is responsible for executing your app's bundle and where the React part of React Native lives.
React Native Runtime uses [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread) and [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread) to execute your code.

You can learn more about it by reading the [JavaScript Runtime](https://reactnative.dev/docs/javascript-environment) article in the official React Native docs.

## JavaScript thread

JavaScript thread (or JS thread for short) is responsible for handling JavaScript code execution in the app.

This is the primary place where the React Native app code is executed.

## UI thread

UI thread is responsible for handling user interface updates. Also known as Main thread.

You can learn more about it by reading the [Threading model](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/threading-model) article in the official React Native docs.

## Animations in inline styling

Passing shared values directly to `style` property without the use of `useAnimatedStyle`.

For example:

```jsx
function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  return <Animated.View style={{ width }} />;
}
```

## Reanimated Babel plugin

The plugin performs automatic [workletization](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) of certain functions used with Reanimated to reduce the amount of boilerplate code.

You can learn the details by reading the [Reanimated Babel plugin README](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/blob/main/packages/react-native-worklets/plugin/README-dev.md).

## Serializable

A Serializable is an object that represents a JavaScript value that can be copied between [Worklet Runtimes](/docs/fundamentals/glossary/#worklet-runtime). JavaScript values cannot be passed to other runtimes without prior serialization.

## SerializableRef

A `SerializableRef` is a reference to a `Serializable` object.
