# Compatibility table

:::info
Worklets aren't tested on the Legacy Architecture (Paper). We highly recommend migrating to the New Architecture (Fabric) prior to using Worklets.

### Supported React Native versions

The rule of thumb is that Worklets support at least the last three minor versions of React Native.
