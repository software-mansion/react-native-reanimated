# scheduleOnUI

`scheduleOnUI` lets you schedule a function to be executed on the [UI Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-runtime) from [RN Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#react-native-runtime-rn-runtime). The callback executes asynchronously and doesn't return a value.


## Reference

```javascript
import { scheduleOnUI } from 'react-native-worklets';

const myFunction = (): void => {
  'worklet';
  console.log('Hello from the UI Runtime!');
};

scheduleOnUI(myFunction); // Hello from the UI Runtime!
```


<details>
<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function scheduleOnUI<Args extends unknown[], ReturnValue>(
  fun: (...args: Args) => ReturnValue,
  ...args: Args
): void
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### fun

A reference to a function you want to schedule on the [UI Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-runtime).

#### args

Arguments to pass to the function.

## Remarks

- The callback passed as the argument is automatically [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) and ready to be run on the [UI Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-runtime).

- Make sure not to execute `scheduleOnUI` on the [UI Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-runtime) or [Worker Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#worker-worklet-runtime---worker-runtime) as this will result in an error, unless you have the [Bundle Mode](/docs/experimental/bundleMode) enabled.

- On the Web, `scheduleOnUI` schedules work to run on the next animation frame using `requestAnimationFrame`.
