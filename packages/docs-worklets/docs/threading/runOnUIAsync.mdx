# runOnUIAsync

`runOnUIAsync` lets you asynchronously run [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) functions on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).
It returns a Promise of the worklet's return value. The Promise is resolved asynchronously, not immediately after the callback execution.

## Reference

```javascript   
import { runOnUIAsync } from 'react-native-worklets';

// RN Runtime, JS thread

const result: Promise<number> = runOnUIAsync((): number => {
  return 1;
})();

await result; // 1
```

<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function runOnUIAsync<Args extends unknown[], ReturnValue>(
  worklet: (...args: Args) => ReturnValue
): (...args: Args) => Promise<ReturnValue> 
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### worklet

A reference to a function you want to execute on the UI thread. Arguments to your function have to be passed to the function returned from `runOnUIAsync` i.e. `runOnUIAsync(setValue)(10);`.

## Remarks

- It's a common mistake to execute function inside of `runOnUIAsync` like this: ~~`runOnUIAsync(myWorklet(10))()`~~. Here, the correct usage would be `runOnUIAsync(myWorklet)(10)`.

- The callback passed as the argument is automatically [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) and ready to be run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

- Make sure not to execute `runOnUIAsync` on the UI thread as this will result in an error.
