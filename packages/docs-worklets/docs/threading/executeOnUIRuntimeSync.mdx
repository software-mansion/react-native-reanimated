## Remarks

- It's a common mistake to execute function inside of `executeOnUIRuntimeSync` like this: ~~`executeOnUIRuntimeSync(myWorklet(10))()`~~. Here, the correct usage would be `executeOnUIRuntimeSync(myWorklet)(10)`.

- The callback passed as the argument is automatically [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) and ready to be run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

- Make sure not to execute `executeOnUIRuntimeSync` on the UI thread as this will result in an error.
