# Getting started

The goal of the _Fundamentals_ section is to help you gain a strong foundation on the core concepts of Reanimated and give you the confidence to explore more advanced use cases on your own. This section is packed with interactive examples, code snippets and explanations. Are you ready? Let's dive in!

## What is React Native Reanimated?

React Native Reanimated is a powerful animation library built by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).

With Reanimated, you can easily create smooth animations and interactions that run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

## Quick start

If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new Expo app using a template:

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npx create-expo-app@latest my-app -e with-reanimated
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">
    ```bash
    yarn create expo-app my-app -e with-reanimated
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can dive into [our examples](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/tree/3.14.0/apps/common-app/src/examples) on GitHub.

## Installation

It takes three steps to add Reanimated to a project:

### Step 1: Install the package

Install `react-native-reanimated` package from npm:

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>
    ```bash
    npx expo install react-native-reanimated
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install react-native-reanimated
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">
    ```bash
    yarn add react-native-reanimated
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Add Reanimated's babel plugin

Add `react-native-reanimated/plugin` plugin to your `babel.config.js`.

```js {7}
  module.exports = {
    presets: [
      ... // don't add it here :)
    ],
    plugins: [
      ...
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
```

:::caution

`react-native-reanimated/plugin` has to be listed last.

<summary>Why do I need this?</summary>

In short, the Reanimated babel plugin automatically converts special JavaScript functions (called [worklets](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#worklet)) to allow them to be passed and run on the UI thread.

To learn more about the plugin head onto to [Reanimated babel plugin](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#reanimated-babel-plugin) section.

### Step 3: Wrap metro config with reanimated wrapper (recommended)

Wrap your existing Metro configuration in the `metro.config.js` file with the `wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig` function.

```js
// metro.config.js
const {
  wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig,
} = require('react-native-reanimated/metro-config');

const config = {
  // Your existing Metro configuration options
};

module.exports = wrapWithReanimatedMetroConfig(config);
```

<details>
<summary>Why should I do this?</summary>

Wrapping your Metro configuration with the Reanimated Metro config wrapper will result in displaying improved reanimated errors and warnings with more accurate call stacks. Thanks to this, identifying misuses of the Reanimated API will be much easier than before.

To learn more about this feature, head onto to [Accurate Call Stacks](/docs/debugging/accurate-call-stacks).

### Step 4: Clear Metro bundler cache (recommended)

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>
    ```bash
    npx expo start -c
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm start -- --reset-cache
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">
    ```bash
    yarn start --reset-cache
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Expo development build

When using an [Expo development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/), run prebuild to update the native code in the `ios` and `android` directories.

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

### Platform specific setup

#### Android

No additional steps are necessary.

#### iOS

While developing for iOS, make sure to install [pods](https://cocoapods.org/) first before running the app:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

#### Web

For building apps that target web using [react-native-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-web) we highly recommend to use [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

To use Reanimated on the web all you need to do is to install and add [`@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from) Babel plugin to your `babel.config.js`.

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO" default>
    ```bash
    npx expo install @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">
    ```bash
    yarn add @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```js {7}
  module.exports = {
      presets: [
        ... // don't add it here :)
      ],
      plugins: [
          ...
          '@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from',
          'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      ],
  };
```

Make sure to list `react-native-reanimated/plugin` last.

More advanced use cases such as running Reanimated with `webpack` or with `Next.js` are explained in a separate [Web Support](/docs/guides/web-support) guide.
