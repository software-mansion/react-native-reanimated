## `pow`

```js
pow(nodeOrNumber1, nodeOrNumber2, ...)
```

Takes two or more animated nodes or values, and when evaluated, returns the result of first node to the second node power. If more than two nodes are present, the result from the previous step is used as a base and the third node as exponent. This process continues onward for the following nodes if these are present.
