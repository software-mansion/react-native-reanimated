## `set`

```js
set(valueToBeUpdated, sourceNode);
```

When evaluated, it will assign the value of `sourceNode` to the `Animated.Value` passed as a first argument. In other words, it performs an assignment operation from the `sourceNode` to `valueToBeUpdated` value node and also returns a node that represents this value.
