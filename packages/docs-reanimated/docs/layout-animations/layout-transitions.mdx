# Layout transitions

Layout transition allows you to animate changes in the layout of elements.

import LayoutTransitions from '@site/src/examples/LayoutTransitions';
import LayoutTransitionsSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/LayoutTransitions';
import ExampleVideo from '@site/src/components/ExampleVideo';

<InteractiveExample src={LayoutTransitionsSrc} component={LayoutTransitions} />

## Predefined Transitions

Below we listed all of the currently available predefined layout transitions with their [layout animation modifiers](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#layout-animation-modifier).

## Linear transition

Linear transition animates both position and dimension in the same way.

### Reference

```js
import { LinearTransition } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  return <Animated.View layout={LinearTransition} />;
}
```

### Modifiers

#### Time-based <Optional/>

Time-based modifiers relay on [`withTiming`](/docs/animations/withTiming) function.

```javascript
LinearTransition.duration(500).easing(Easing.ease);
```

- `.easing(easingFunction: EasingFunction)` is an easing function which defines the animation curve. Defaults to `Easing.inOut(Easing.quad)`

:::note
Time-based modifiers have no effect when `.springify()` is used.
:::

#### Spring-based <Optional/>

Spring-based modifiers relay on [`withSpring`](/docs/animations/withSpring) function.

```javascript
LinearTransition.springify()
  .damping(30)
  .mass(5)
  .rotate(20)
  .stiffness(10)
  .overshootClamping(false)
  .restDisplacementThreshold(0.1)
  .restSpeedThreshold(5);
```

- `.springify()` enables the spring-based animation configuration.
- `.damping(value: number)` decides how quickly a spring stops moving. Higher damping means the spring will come to rest faster. Defaults to `10`.
- `.dampingRatio(value: number)` decides how damped the spring is. Value `1` means the spring is critically dmaped, and value `>1` means the spring is overdamped. Defaults to `0.5`.
- `.mass(value: number)` is the weight of the spring. Reducing this value makes the animation faster. Defaults to `1`.
- `.rotate(degree: string)` lets you rotate the element.
- `.stiffness(value: number)` decides how bouncy the spring is. Defaults to `100`.
- `.overshootClamping(value: boolean)` decides whether a spring can bounce over the designated position. Defaults to `false`.
- `.restDisplacementThreshold(value: number)` is the displacement below which the spring will snap to the designated position without further oscillations. Defaults to `0.001`.
- `.restSpeedThreshold(value: number)` is the speed in pixels per second from which the spring will snap to the designated position without further oscillations. Defaults to `2`.

#### Common <Optional/>

```javascript
LinearTransition.delay(500)
  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)
  .withInitialValues({ transform: [{ translateY: 420 }] })
  .withCallback((finished) => {
    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);
  });
```

- `.duration(duration: number)` sets length of the animation (in milliseconds). Defaults to '300'.
- `.delay(durationMs: number)` is the delay before the animation starts (in milliseconds). Defaults to `0`.
- `.reduceMotion(reduceMotion: ReduceMotion)` determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.
- `.withInitialValues(values: StyleProps)` allows to override the initial config of the animation.
- `.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void)` is the callback that will fire after the animation ends. Sets `finished` to `true` when animation ends without interruptions, and `false` otherwise.

### Example

<ExampleVideo
  sources={{
    android:
      '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/android_linear_transition.mov',
    ios: '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/ios_linear_transition.mov',
  }}
/>

## Sequenced Transition

Sequenced transition animates first x-position and width, then later y-position and height.

### Reference

```js
import { SequencedTransition } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  return <Animated.View layout={SequencedTransition} />;
}
```

### Modifiers

```javascript
SequencedTransition.duration(1000)
  .delay(500)
  .reverse()
  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)
  .withCallback((finished) => {
    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);
  });
```

- `.duration(duration: number)` sets length of the animation (in milliseconds). Defaults to '300'.
- `.delay(durationMs: number)` is the delay before the animation starts (in milliseconds). Defaults to `0`.
- `.reverse()` determines if the animation should run in reverse. Defaults to `false`.
- `.reduceMotion(reduceMotion: ReduceMotion)` determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.
- `.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void)` is the callback that will fire after the animation ends. Sets `finished` to `true` when animation ends without interruptions, and `false` otherwise.

import { FadingTransition } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  return <Animated.View layout={FadingTransition} />;
}
```

### Modifiers

```javascript

  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)
  .withCallback((finished) => {
    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);
  });
```

    android:
      '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/android_jumping_transition.mov',
    ios: '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/ios_jumping_transition.mov',
  }}
/>

## Curved Transition

Curved transition enables to animate each position and dimension with different easing. It makes animation look curved.

### Reference

```js
import { CurvedTransiton } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  return <Animated.View layout={CurvedTransiton} />;
}
```

### Modifiers

```javascript
CurvedTransiton.duration(1000)
  .delay(500)
  .easingX(Easing.in(Easing.exp))
  .easingY(Easing.out(Easing.quad))
  .easingWidth(Easing.in(Easing.ease))
  .easingHeight(Easing.out(Easing.exp))
  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)
  .withCallback((finished) => {
    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);
  });
```

- `.duration(duration: number)` sets length of the animation (in milliseconds). Defaults to '300'.
- `.delay(durationMs: number)` is the delay before the animation starts (in milliseconds). Defaults to `0`.
- `.easingX(easing: EasingFunction)` defines easing animation for x-position.
- `.easingY(easing: EasingFunction)` defines easing animation for y-position.
- `.easingWidth(easing: EasingFunction)` defines easing animation for width.
- `.easingHeight(easing: EasingFunction)` defines easing animation for height.
- `.reduceMotion(reduceMotion: ReduceMotion)` determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.
- `.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void)` is the callback that will fire after the animation ends. Sets `finished` to `true` when animation ends without interruptions, and `false` otherwise.

### Example

<ExampleVideo
  sources={{
    android:
      '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/android_curved_transition.mov',
    ios: '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/ios_curved_transition.mov',
  }}
/>

## Entry/Exit Transition

Entry/Exit transition lets you choose layout animations for entering and exiting. Moreover, instead of picking currently available animations, you are welcome to create your own one.

### Reference

```js
import { EntryExitTransition } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  return <Animated.View layout={EntryExitTransition} />;
}
```

### Modifiers

```javascript
EntryExitTransition.duration(1000)
  .delay(500)
  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)
  .withCallback((finished) => {
    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);
  });
```

- `.duration(duration: number)` sets length of the animation (in milliseconds). Defaults to '300'.
- `.delay(durationMs: number)` is the delay before the animation starts (in milliseconds). Defaults to `0`.
- `.exiting(animation)` determines animation shown when element is removed from position. Defaults to `FadeOut`.
- `.entering(animation)` determines animation shown when element is added to new position. Defaults to `FadeIn`.
- `.reduceMotion(reduceMotion: ReduceMotion)` determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.
- `.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void)` is the callback that will fire after the animation ends. Sets `finished` to `true` when animation ends without interruptions, and `false` otherwise.

### Remarks

- Duration equals sum of entering and exiting durations.
- You cannot use spring animations as entering/exiting as they don't have a fixed duration.

### Example

  sources={{
    android:
      '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/android_entryexit_transition.mov',
    ios: '/react-native-reanimated/recordings/layout_transitions/ios_entryexit_transition.mov',
  }}
