# Keyframe animations

The document explains how you can define complex animation using simple and popular animation definitions schema - Keyframes.

## Reference

```javascript
import { Keyframe } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const keyframe = new Keyframe({
  0: {
    transform: [{ rotate: '0deg' }],
  },
  45: {
    transform: [{ rotate: '100deg' }],
    easing: Easing.exp,
  },
  100: {
    transform: [{ rotate: '45deg' }],
  },
});

function App() {
  return <Animated.View entering={keyframe} />;
}
```

### Arguments

#### `definitions`

An object, passed as an argument to the Keyframe's constructor. It contains definitions of your animation.
The object keys should be within range `0-100` and correspond to animation progress.
The object values should consist of style props and/or [easing](/docs/animations/withTiming/#easing) function.

- `0` or `from`: Initial state of the object.
- `100` or `to`: Final state of the object.
- Middle points (e.g., `45`): Intermediate states of the object.

To `0` assign the style, you want for your object at the beginning of the animation and to `100` assign the style you want for your object to have at the end of the animation.

## Remarks

- Providing keyframe `0` or `from` is required as it contains the initial state of the object you want to animate.
- Ensure you provide the initial value for all style properties you want to animate in other keyframes.
- Do not provide both 0 and from, or 100 and to keyframes, as it will result in a parsing conflict.
- If you want to animate transform style, make sure that all properties in the transformation array are in the same order in all keyframes.
- If easing property is not provided, it defaults to `Easing.linear`.

## Modifiers

```javascript
keyframe
  .duration(1000)
  .delay(500)
  .reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.Never)
  .withCallback((finished) => {
    console.log(`finished without interruptions: ${finished}`);
  });
```

- `.duration(durationMs: number)` is the length of the animation (in milliseconds). Defaults to `300`.
- `.delay(durationMs: number)` is the delay before the animation starts (in milliseconds). Defaults to `0`.
- `.reduceMotion(reduceMotion: ReduceMotion)` determines how the animation responds to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting.
- `.withCallback(callback: (finished: boolean) => void)` is the callback that will fire after the animation ends. Sets `finished` to `true` when animation ends without interruptions, and `false` otherwise.
