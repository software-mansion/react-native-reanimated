`ReducedMotionConfig` component let's you change behavior in response to the device's reduced motion accessibility setting. By default it disables all animation when the reduced motion is enabled on a device. You can adjust it for your specific use case. You can learn more about [Accessibility](/docs/guides/accessibility) and [`useReducedMotion`](/docs/device/useReducedMotion) in Reanimated.

:::caution

The new configuration will be applied globally across the entire application.

### Arguments

#### `mode`

A parameter that determines how animations should behave in response to the device's reduce motion accessibility setting.

- `ReduceMotion.System` - This value adjusts the animation behavior based on whether the reduced motion accessibility setting is activated on the device. When enabled, the animation is disabled; otherwise, it remains active.
- `ReduceMotion.Always` - With this setting, the animation is consistently disabled, regardless of the device's accessibility configuration.
- `ReduceMotion.Never` - This option ensures that the animation remains enabled at all times.

import ReducedMotionConfig from '@site/src/examples/ReducedMotionConfig';
import ReducedMotionConfigSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/ReducedMotionConfig';
