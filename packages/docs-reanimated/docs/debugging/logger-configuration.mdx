# Logger configuration

Reanimated shows warnings that indicate misuses of the library API, such as modifying the [shared value](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value) during component re-render. These logs can be configured to be more or less verbose. The **default** configuration shows **all warnings and errors**. You can change this behavior by using the `configureReanimatedLogger` function.

## Reference

To configure the Reanimated logger, import `configureReanimatedLogger` from `react-native-reanimated` and call it with the desired configuration.

```js
import {
  configureReanimatedLogger,
  ReanimatedLogLevel,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';

// This is a default configuration
configureReanimatedLogger({
  level: ReanimatedLogLevel.warn,
  strict: true, // Reanimated runs in strict mode by default
});
```

<details>
<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function configureReanimatedLogger(config: LoggerConfig): void;

type LoggerConfig = {
  level?: ReanimatedLogLevel;
  strict?: boolean;
};

enum ReanimatedLogLevel {
  warn = 1,
  error = 2,
}
```

</details>

### Configuration options

#### `level`

A value od the `ReanimatedLogLevel` enum that defines the minimum level of the logs that will be shown.

#### `strict`

A boolean value that enables or disables strict mode. When strict mode is enabled, Reanimated will show more warnings that can help you to catch potential issues in your code.

## Remarks

- The logger configuration is global and affects all Reanimated animations in your app.

- The `configureReanimatedLogger` function should be called before any Reanimated animations are created, e.g. in the root file of your app.

- The `configureReanimatedLogger` function is intended for application developers. If you are creating a library that relies on Reanimated, do not include this function call in your library source code.
