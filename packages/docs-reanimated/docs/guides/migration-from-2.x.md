Reanimated 3.x doesn't introduce any breaking changes between 2.x and 3.x in terms of the API. All the code you've written in Reanimated v2 API works in 3.x without any changes. However, Reanimated 3.x drops the Reanimated v1 API entirely. For the migration guide between 1.x and 2.x versions please consult [Migration from 1.x to 2.x](/docs/guides/migration-from-1.x.md).
