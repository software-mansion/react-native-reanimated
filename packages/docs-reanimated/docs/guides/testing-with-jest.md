This page was ported from an old version of the documentation.

Reanimated test mocks use web implementation of Reanimated2. Before you begin using Reanimated mocks you need some setup actions.

## Setup

First, make sure that your tests run with Node version 16 or newer.

Add the following line to your `jest-setup.js` file:

```js
require('react-native-reanimated').setUpTests();
```

`setUpTests()` can take optional config argument. Default config is `{ fps: 60 }`, setting framerate to 60fps.

To be sure, check if your `jest.config.js` file contains:

```js
...
preset: 'react-native',
setupFilesAfterEnv: ['./jest-setup.js'],
...
```

:::caution

If you use Jest in a version **older than 28**, you should set `setupFiles` property instead of `setupFilesAfterEnv`

:::

If you have custom babel configuration for testing, make sure that Reanimated's babel plugin is enabled in that environment.

## API

#### Style checker

- Checking equality of selected styles with current component styles

  #### `expect(component).toHaveAnimatedStyle(expectedStyle)`

  `component` - tested component
  `expectedStyle` - contains expected styles of testing component, for example `{ width: 100 }`

- Checking equality of all current component styles with expected styles

  #### `expect(component).toHaveAnimatedStyle(expectedStyle, {exact: true})`

- You can get all styles of tested component by using `getDefaultStyle`
  #### `getDefaultStyle(component)`
  `component` - tested component

#### Timers

You can use Jest's fake timers to control animation progress.
Check [the full guide about mocking timers on Jest documentation website](https://jestjs.io/docs/timer-mocks).

```js
jest.useFakeTimers();
// call animation
jest.runAllTimers();
```

If you want more control over animation, you can use `jest.advanceTimersByTime` to move to a certain point in the animation:

```js
jest.useFakeTimers();
// call animation
jest.advanceTimersByTime(250);
// make assertions on what you expect the styles of a component should be after 250ms
```

## Example

The below code shows an example of test that runs a 250ms of animation and verifies the component style after that point in time.

```js
// Setup fake timers â€“ this can be done before the tests are run
jest.useFakeTimers();

test('stop in the middle of animation', () => {
  const style = { width: 0 };

  const { getByTestId } = render(<AnimatedComponent />);
  const view = getByTestId('view');
  const button = getByTestId('button');

  expect(view.props.style.width).toBe(0);
  expect(view).toHaveAnimatedStyle(style);

  fireEvent.press(button);
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(250); // if whole animation duration is a 500ms
  style.width = 50; // value of component width after 250ms of animation
  expect(view).toHaveAnimatedStyle(style);
});
```
