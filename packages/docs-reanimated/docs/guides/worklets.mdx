# Worklets

Worklets are short-running JavaScript functions that can be run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread). They can also be run on a JavaScript thread just as you would run a function in your code.

You can create your own worklets using the `"worklet";` directive at the top of a function.

```javascript
function myWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log('Running on the UI thread');
}
```

The Reanimated Babel Plugin looks for functions marked with the `"worklet"` directive and coverts them into serializable objects. These objects can then be copied and run over on the UI thread. We call this process [workletization](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize).

[`runOnUI`](/docs/threading/runOnUI) lets you manually run worklets on the UI thread:

```javascript
function myWorklet(greeting) {
  'worklet';
  console.log(`${greeting} from the UI thread`);
}

function onPress() {
  // highlight-next-line
  runOnUI(myWorklet)('Howdy');
}
```

this can lead to performance issues.

Most of the time when working with Reanimated the code is automatically [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) and run on the UI thread by default.

```javascript
import { useAnimatedStyle } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    console.log('Running on the UI thread');
    return { opacity: 0.5 };
  });
}
```
