# Worklets

Worklets are short-running JavaScript functions that can be run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread). Reanimated uses worklets to update view properties and react to events on the UI thread.

You can create your own worklets using the `"worklet";` directive at the top of a function.

```javascript
function myWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log('Running on the UI thread');
}
```

The [Reanimated Babel Plugin](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/blob/main/packages/react-native-reanimated/plugin/README-dev.md#basics) looks for functions marked with the `"worklet"` directive and coverts them into serializable objects. We call this process [workletization](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize). These objects can then be copied and run over on the UI thread.

Most of the time when working with Reanimated and [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/) the code is automatically workletized and run on the UI thread by default.

```javascript
import { useAnimatedStyle } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    // Running on the UI thread
    return { opacity: 0.5 };
  });
}
```

The `"worklet";` directive has no effect on the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread). Worklets on the JavaScript thread are just functions.

You can use [`runOnUI`](/docs/threading/runOnUI) to manually run worklets on the UI thread:

```javascript
function myWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log('Hello from the UI thread');
}

function onPress() {
  runOnUI(myWorklet)();
}
```

You can pass data as arguments to worklets.

```javascript
function myWorklet(greeting) {
  'worklet';
  console.log(`${greeting} from the UI thread`);
}

function onPress() {
  runOnUI(myWorklet)('Howdy');
}
```

Worklets are [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures). They can access variables declared outside of it's own scope. Only variables referenced in the worklet body will be captured inside the worklet scope.

```javascript
const width = 135.5;

function otherWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log('Captured width is', width);
}
```

Capturing big JavaScript objects inside of a worklet can lead to performance issues.

```javascript
const theme = {...}; // theme is a big object

function myWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log(theme.color); // 🚨 referenced `color` but captured the whole `theme` object
}
```

You can get around this problem by first assigning the prop you want to use to a separate variable .

```javascript
const theme = {...};
const color = theme.color;

function myWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log(color); // ✅ captured only `color`
}
```

Worklets can return data within the same thread.

```javascript
function returningWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  return "I'm back"; // on the UI thread
}

function someWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  let what = returningWorklet(); // still on the UI thread
  console.log('On the UI thread, other worklet says', what);
}
```

To pass data between UI and JS thread we use [shared values](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value).

```javascript
import { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  const width = useSharedValue(100);

  function myWorklet() {
    'worklet';
    width.value += 50;
  }

  width.value; // available on both JS and UI thread
}
```

You can run functions on the JS thread from UI thread with [`runOnJS`](/docs/threading/runOnJS). Most frequently used to call function that aren't marked with a `"worklet";` directive (i.e. most 3rd party libraries) or to update the React state.

```javascript
import { router } from 'expo-router';
import { Gesture } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

function App() {
  const tap = Gesture.Tap().onEnd(() => {
    // i'm a worklet too!
    // highlight-next-line
    runOnJS(router.back)();
  });
}
```
