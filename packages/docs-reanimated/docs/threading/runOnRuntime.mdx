# runOnRuntime

`runOnRuntime` lets you asynchronously run [workletized](/docs/next/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) functions on a separate worklet runtime on a separate thread.

## Reference

```javascript
import { createWorkletRuntime, runOnRuntime } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const workletRuntime = createWorkletRuntime('background');

function App() {
  // E.g. in event handler or in an effect
  // highlight-next-line
  runOnRuntime(workletRuntime, (greeting) => {
    console.log(`${greeting} from a separate thread`);
    // highlight-next-line
  })('Howdy');

  // ...
}
```

<details>
<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function runOnRuntime<A extends any[], R>(
  workletRuntime: WorkletRuntime,
  fn: (...args: A) => R
): (...args: Parameters<typeof fn>) => void;
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### workletRuntime

A reference to worklet runtime created with [`createWorkletRuntime`](/docs/next/threading/createWorkletRuntime).

#### fn

A reference to a function you want to execute on the [UI thread](/docs/next/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread) from the [JavaScript thread](/docs/next/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread). Arguments to your function have to be passed to the function returned from `runOnUI` i.e. `runOnUI(myWorklet)(10);`.

### Returns

`runOnRuntime` returns a function that accepts arguments for the function passed as the first argument.

:::info
Don't forget to call the function returned from `runOnRuntime`.
:::

## Remarks

- It's a common mistake to execute function inside of `runOnRuntime` like this: ~~`runOnRuntime(myWorklet(10))()`~~. Here, the correct usage would be `runOnRuntime(myWorklet)(10)`.

- The callback passed as the argument will not be [workletized](/docs/next/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) automatically. You need to add `'worklet';` directive manually to allow the function to be run on the [UI thread](/docs/next/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

- You may call `runOnRuntime` on any runtime, including the RN runtime, UI runtime and other worklet runtimes.

- The function passed to `runOnRuntime` will be added to an execution queue on a separate thread and executed asynchronously on the specified worklet runtime. The functions will be executed in the order they were added to the queue.
