# Getting started

The goal of the _Fundamentals_ section is to help you gain a strong foundation on the core concepts of Reanimated and give you the confidence to explore more advanced use cases on your own. This section is packed with interactive examples, code snippets and explanations. Are you ready? Let's dive in!

## What is React Native Reanimated?

React Native Reanimated is a powerful animation library built by [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/).

With Reanimated, you can easily create smooth animations and interactions that run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

## Prerequisites

Reanimated 4.x works only with [the React Native New Architecture (Fabric)](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page).
If your app still uses the old architecture, you can use Reanimated in version 3 which is still actively maintained.

Alternatively, you can dive into [our examples](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/tree/main/apps/common-app/src/apps) on GitHub.

## Installation

It takes two steps to add Reanimated 4 to an Expo project:

### Step 1: Install the package

Install `react-native-reanimated@next` and `react-native-worklets` packages from npm:

:::note

`react-native-worklets` is currently a required dependency. It was separated from `react-native-reanimated` for better modularity.

:::

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    {/* TODO (for the future) - add information to specify a proper version of react-native-worklets during installation, compatible with the version of Reanimated */}
    npm install react-native-reanimated@next react-native-worklets

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add react-native-reanimated@next

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Rebuild native dependencies

Run prebuild to update the native code in the `ios` and `android` directories.

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npx expo prebuild

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn expo prebuild

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And that's it! Reanimated 4 is now configured in your Expo project.

### React Native Community CLI

When using [React Native Community CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli), you also need to manually add the `react-native-reanimated/plugin` plugin to your `babel.config.js`.

```js {7}
  module.exports = {
    presets: [
      ... // don't add it here :)
    ],
    plugins: [
      ...
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    ],
  };
```

:::caution

`react-native-reanimated/plugin` has to be listed last.

:::

<details>
<summary>Why do I need this?</summary>

In short, the Reanimated babel plugin automatically converts special JavaScript functions (called [worklets](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#worklet)) to allow them to be passed and run on the UI thread.

Since [Expo SDK 50](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/01-18-sdk-50), the Expo starter template includes the Reanimated babel plugin by default.

To learn more about the plugin head onto to [Reanimated babel plugin](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#reanimated-babel-plugin) section.

#### Clear Metro bundler cache (recommended)

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm start -- --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn start --reset-cache

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Android

No additional steps are necessary.

#### iOS

While developing for iOS, make sure to install [pods](https://cocoapods.org/) first before running the app:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

#### Web

For building apps that target web using [react-native-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-web) we highly recommend to use [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

To use Reanimated on the web all you need to do is to install and add [`@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from) Babel plugin to your `babel.config.js`.

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```js {7}
  module.exports = {
      presets: [
        ... // don't add it here :)
      ],
      plugins: [
          ...
          '@babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from',
          'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      ],
  };
```

Make sure to list `react-native-reanimated/plugin` last.

More advanced use cases such as running Reanimated with `webpack` or with `Next.js` are explained in a separate [Web Support](/docs/guides/web-support) guide.
