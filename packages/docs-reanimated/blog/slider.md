Slider allows users to adjust a value or control a setting by sliding a handle along a track. It is commonly used to adjust settings such as volume, brightness, or in this case, the width of a box.

import Slider from '@site/static/examples/Slider';
import SliderSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/static/examples/Slider';
import ExampleVideo from '@site/src/components/ExampleVideo';
import CollapsibleCode from '@site/src/components/CollapsibleCode';

<InteractiveExample src={SliderSrc} component={Slider} />

We use the `useSharedValue` hook to store the offset of the slider handle, allowing for smooth animation during sliding.

<CollapsibleCode src={SliderSrc} showLines={[24,24]}/>

This example is done using [Pan gesture](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/gestures/pan-gesture) from `react-native-gesture-handler` library. It adjusts the handle's position and width of the box accordingly to the current offset. The offset is a [shared value](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value) and is updated during the `onChange` event of the pan gesture.

  }}
/>

The `useAnimatedStyle` hook is used to create animated styles for both the box and the slider handle. This ensures that changes to the offset value result in smooth animations for both components.

Leveraging animated props allows us to run them on the UI thread instead of the JS thread. To prevent unnecessary re-renders when the text displaying the current width of the box changes, we used the `useAnimatedProps` hook.

Additionally, we opted for **TextInput** instead of **Text** because **TextInput** has a `text` property that can be animated, whereas **Text** only has children.

This approach also enabled us to animate **TextInput** using [shared values](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value).
