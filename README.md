### React Native's Animated library reimplemented

> Reanimated 3 is here! Check out our [documentation page](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) for more information

low level abstraction for the Animated library API to be built
on top of and hence allow for much greater flexibility especially when it
comes to gesture based interactions.
