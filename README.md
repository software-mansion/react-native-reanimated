# Reanimated & Worklets

This repository contains two main packages:

- [React Native Reanimated](/packages/react-native-reanimated) — a library for creating smooth animations and interactions in React Native,
- [React Native Worklets](/packages/react-native-worklets) — a library that enables multi-threaded JavaScript execution in React Native applications.

### Create smooth animations with an excellent developer experience.
