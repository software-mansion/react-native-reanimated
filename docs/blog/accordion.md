An accordion allows to show and hide a piece of content with a smooth animation. Commonly used in "FAQ" sections.

import Accordion from '@site/static/examples/Accordion';
import AccordionSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/static/examples/Accordion';
import ExampleVideo from '@site/src/components/ExampleVideo';

<InteractiveExample src={AccordionSrc} component={<Accordion />} />

The following implementation of an accordion relies on [shared values](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value). Leveraging shared values helps to prevent unnecessary re-renders. We define shared values using the useSharedValue hook.

<CollapsibleCode src={AccordionSrc} showLines={[16,16]}/>

  }}

The **AccordionItem** component encapsulates each item in the accordion. A `height` shared value manages the height of the item. The height dynamically adjusts based on the `isExpanded` prop, resulting in smooth expansion and collapse animations. The `duration` prop controls the duration of the animation.

Inside the **AccordionItem**, the children represent the content section. It can accommodate various types of content.
