This project aims to supersede the current stable Reanimated documentation which is hosted on [https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).

## What's in the docs

The new docs comes with a [Fundamentals](https://reanimated-beta-docs.swmansion.com/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) section which step-by-step introduction into the world of Reanimated.

All sections are sprinkled with interactive examples, playground and code snippets designed to be easily copyable to be run in your projects.
