## What's in the docs

The Docs come with a [Fundamentals](https://reanimated-beta-docs.swmansion.com/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) section which is a step-by-step introduction into the world of Reanimated.

All sections feature interactive examples, playgrounds, and easily copyable code snippets designed for use in your projects.
