`useReducedMotion` lets you query the reduced motion system setting. You can use it to disable animations.

## Reference

```javascript
import { useReducedMotion } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  const reduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  if (reduceMotion) {
    // display static content ✨
  } else {
    // run animations ✨
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Returns

`useReducedMotion` returns a boolean indicating whether the reduced motion setting was enabled when the app started.

## Example

import UseReducedMotion from '@site/src/examples/UseReducedMotion';
import UseReducedMotionSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/UseReducedMotion';

<InteractiveExample
  src={UseReducedMotionSrc}
  component={<UseReducedMotion />}
/>

## Remarks

- Changing the reduced motion system setting doesn't cause your components to rerender.
- In contrast to [`AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo#isreducemotionenabled) the `useReducedMotion` hook lets you get the value synchronously.
