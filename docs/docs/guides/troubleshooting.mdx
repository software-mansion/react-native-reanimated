# Troubleshooting

Reanimated is known for its stability and compatibility so it's extremely unlikely you will ever have to visit this page. If you had to, please contact us at `contact@swmansion.com`.

## Version mismatching

Reanimated has four core components that compose its code:

- C++,
- Java,
- JavaScript,
- Reanimated Babel plugin.

All of them are supposed to work correctly only within the same minor version. Therefore, having any of those pieces in your code - directly or indirectly - separate from `react-native-reanimated`, especially having any code transpiled with a different version of the aforementioned plugin will result in undefined behavior and errors.

---

### Unknown version of Reanimated Babel plugin

This can happen when:

1. Part of your code is transpiled with Reanimated Babel plugin that wasn't injecting its version yet. See [Mismatch between JavaScript code version and Reanimated Babel plugin version](http://localhost:3000/react-native-reanimated/docs/guides/Troubleshooting#mismatch-between-javascript-code-version-and-reanimated-babel-plugin-version).
2. You use release bundle with debug build of the app. This is not supported. See this [post](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/4737) for more information about it.

### Mismatch between JavaScript code version and Reanimated Babel plugin version

This can happen when:

1. You use code that was transpiled with an outdated version of Reanimated Babel plugin.

Usual solution:

1. Try resetting your Metro bundler cache with `yarn start --reset-cache`, `npm start -- --reset-cache` or `expo start -c` and run the app again.

If this didn't help, you probably have a dependency that contains already transformed worklets bundled with an outdated version of the Reanimated Babel plugin. You can find the offending code that was given alongside the error to find that dependency.

### Using dev bundle in a release app build is not supported

See this [post](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/4737) for more information.

### Tried to synchronously call a non-worklet function on the UI thread

This can happen when you try to call a function that is not marked as a worklet from a worklet. E.g.:

```typescript
function callee() {
  console.log('hello');
}
function caller() {
  'worklet';
  callee(); // <- this will throw in `runOnUI`
}
runOnUI(caller)();
```

In this example, `callee` cannot be called from a worklet ran on UI thread because there is no corresponding UI function for `callee`.

Possible solutions are:

1. If you want to synchronously execute this method, mark it as a worklet using `worklet` directive:

```diff
function callee(){
+   'worklet';
    console.log("hello");
  }
```

2. If you want to execute this function on the JS thread, wrap it using `runOnJS`:

```diff
function caller(){
  'worklet';
-   callee();
+   runOnJS(callee)();
}
```

Check [this page](http://localhost:3000/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/glossary#worklet) to learn more about Reanimated and its worklets.

### Failed to create a worklet

This usually happens when Reanimated is not properly installed, e.g. forgetting to include the Reanimated Babel plugin in `babel.config.js`. See installation docs at https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation#babel-plugin for more information.

### [Reanimated] Another instance of `react-native-reanimated` was detected

WIP

### Native part of Reanimated doesn't seem to be initialized

This could be caused by:

- not rebuilding the app after installing or upgrading Reanimated,
- trying to run Reanimated on an unsupported platform,
- running in a brownfield app without manually initializing the native library.

### Couldn't determine the version of the native part of Reanimated

Did you forget to re-build the app after upgrading react-native-reanimated? If you use Expo Go, you must use the exact version which is bundled into Expo SDK.

### Mismatch between JavaScript part and native part of Reanimated

Did you forget to re-build the app after upgrading react-native-reanimated? If you use Expo Go, you must downgrade to ${cppVersion} which is bundled into Expo SDK.

### Multiple versions of Reanimated were detected in `build.gradle`

Only one instance of react-native-reanimated can be installed in a project. You need to resolve the conflict manually. Check out the documentation: https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/troubleshooting#multiple-versions-of-reanimated-were-detected\n\n

### Outdated version of `react-native` for New Architecture

Reanimated supports only on the latest minor release of React Native. Please upgrade to React Native 0.72.0 or downgrade to an older version of Reanimated v3."
