:::info
Reanimated 2 won't receive support for newest React Native versions. To get the latest React Native features and updates, upgrade to Reanimated 3.
:::

### Supported React Native versions on the New Architecture (Fabric)

To use Reanimated with [the experimental New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/landing-page), update the package to at least version 3.0.0. Due to the vast number of breaking-changes related to the New Architecture in each React Native version, as a rule of thumb Reanimated supports the latest stable version of React Native.
