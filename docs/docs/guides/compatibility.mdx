# Compatibility Table

In order to provide solid, state-of-the arts solutions we often use brand new React Native features,
that are being introduced all the time. Thats why applications with mismatched Reanimated and React Native
versions may show unexpected behavior or even fail to build at all. The table below contains official list
of supported React Native versions.
