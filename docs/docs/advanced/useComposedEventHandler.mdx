# useComposedEventHandler

This is a hook that lets you compose [useEvent](/docs/advanced/useEvent)-based event handlers (such as [useAnimatedScrollHandler](/docs/scroll/useAnimatedScrollHandler) or your own custom ones) into a single, combined event handler.

### Arguments

#### `handlers`

An array of event handlers created using [useEvent](/docs/advanced/useEvent) hook. `useComposedEventHandler` hook reacts to any changes in given handlers and rebuilds whenever it is needed.

### Returns

The hook returns a handler object that can be hooked into any [`Animated component`](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#animated-component).
The handler should be passed to any `onEvent` (e.g. `onScroll`) parameter regardless of what events it handles.

## Example

In the below example we define two different scroll handlers using `useAnimatedScrollHandler`. Then, they are combined by `useComposedEventHandler` hook and passed to `Animated.ScrollView` component.
Now, each dispatched `onScroll` event gets handled by both of handlers, as well as `onBeginDrag` and `onEndDrag` events are handled by the second one.

```jsx {29-32,36}
import Animated, {
  useAnimatedScrollHandler,
  useComposedEventHandler,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';

function ComposedEventHandlerExample() {
  const onScrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({
    onScroll(e) {
      'worklet';
      console.log('Scroll handler scroll event');
    },
  });

  const onScrollAndDragHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({
    onScroll(e) {
      'worklet';
      console.log('Scroll and drag handler scroll event');
    },
    onBeginDrag(e) {
      'worklet';
      console.log('Scroll and drag handler begin drag event');
    },
    onEndDrag(e) {
      'worklet';
      console.log('Scroll and drag handler end drag event');
    },
  });

  const composedHandler = useComposedEventHandler([
    onScrollHandler,
    onScrollAndDragHandler,
  ]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.ScrollView style={styles.scroll} onScroll={composedHandler}>
        <Content />
      </Animated.ScrollView>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Remarks

- The hook returns a handler that combines functionalities of all the handlers given as an argument. This way, you can have more than one handler responding to a given event, as well as handle many different type events using just one object.
- It will still work well when passed to multiple [`Animated components`](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#animated-component), firing event callbacks for each connected component.
