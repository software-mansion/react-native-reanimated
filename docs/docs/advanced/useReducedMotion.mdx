This hook allows you to conditionally control animations based on the system's `Reduced Motion` accessibility setting.

## Reference

```javascript
import { useReducedMotion } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  if (shouldReduceMotion) {
    // display static content ✨
  } else {
    // run animations ✨
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Returns

`useReducedMotion` returns a boolean value that indicates whether the `Reduced Motion` accessibility setting was enabled when the app started.

## Example

import UseReducedMotion from '@site/src/examples/UseReducedMotion';
import UseReducedMotionSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/UseReducedMotion';

<InteractiveExample
  src={UseReducedMotionSrc}
  component={<UseReducedMotion />}
/>

## Remarks

- Keep in mind that the hook doesn't cause the component to reload when the system setting is changed.
