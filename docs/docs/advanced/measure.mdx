# measure

`measure` lets you synchronously get the dimensions and position of a view on the screen, all on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

## Reference

```jsx
import { measure } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  const animatedRef = useAnimatedRef();

  const handlePress = () => {
    runOnUI(() => {
      // highlight-next-line
      const measurement = measure(animatedRef);
      if (measurement === null) {
        return;
      }
      // ...
    })();
  };

  return <Animated.View ref={animatedRef} />;
}
```

<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
interface MeasuredDimensions {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  pageX: number;
  pageY: number;
}

function measure<T extends Component>(
  animatedRef: AnimatedRef<T>
): MeasuredDimensions | null;
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### `animatedRef`

An [animated ref](/docs/core/useAnimatedRef#returns) connected to the component you'd want to get the measurements from. The animated ref has to be passed either to an [Animated component](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#animated-component) or a React Native built-in component.

### Returns

`measure` returns an object containing these fields:

- `x` a number representing X coordinate relative to the parent component,
- `y` a number representing Y coordinate relative to the parent component,
- `width` a number representing the width of the component,
- `height` a number representing the height of the component,
- `pageX` a number representing X coordinate relative to the screen,
- `pageY` a number representing Y coordinate relative to the screen,

or returns `null` when the measurement couldn't be performed.

## Example

import MeasureBasic from '@site/src/examples/MeasureBasic';
import MeasureBasicSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/MeasureBasic';

<InteractiveExample src={MeasureBasicSrc} component={<MeasureBasic />} />

## Remarks

- `measure` is implemented only on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread). When using `measure` inside [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events#adding-event-handlers), it has to be wrapped with the [`runOnUI`](/docs/threading/runOnUI) function.

- The `useAnimatedStyle` function is first evaluated on the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread) just before the views are attached to the native side. For this reason, to safely use the measure within `useAnimatedStyle`, a condition similar to the one below must be added to the code:

<Indent>

```jsx
function App() {
  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    // highlight-next-line
    if (_WORKLET) {
      // safely use measure
      const measurement = measure(animatedRef);
    }
  });
}
```

Consecutive runs of `useAnimatedStyle` are executed on the UI thread.

</Indent>

- When you only need the dimensions of the component and won't use the measurements during animation, consider using the [`onLayout`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#onlayout) property instead.

- Sometimes, `measure` returns `null` (e.g., when the `ref` hasn't yet attached to the view). It's best to add a `null` check after the measurement for added safety.

<Indent>

```jsx
const animatedRef = useAnimatedRef();

const handlePress = () => {
  runOnUI(() => {
    const measurement = measure(animatedRef);

    // highlight-start
    if (measurement === null) {
      return;
    }
    // highlight-end
    // ...
  })();
};
```

</Indent>

- `measure` can be used only on rendered components. For instance, attempting to `measure` off-screen items in a `FlatList` will return a `null` value.

- `measure` isn't available with the Remote JS Debugger. We highly recommend using Chrome DevTools (also known as `chrome://inspect`) for debugging React Native apps.
