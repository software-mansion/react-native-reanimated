# runOnUI

`runOnUI` lets you asynchronously run [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) functions on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

Most commonly used either with an `useEffect` to start an animation on component mount/unmount or with [`measure`](/docs/advanced/measure) and [`scrollTo`](/docs/scroll/scrollTo) functions which have implementations only on the UI thread.

## Reference

```javascript
import { runOnUI } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  // E.g. in event handler or in an effect
  // highlight-next-line
  runOnUI((greeting) => {
    console.log(`${greeting} from the UI thread`);
    // highlight-next-line
  })('Howdy');

  // ...
}
```

<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function runOnUI<A extends any[], R>(
  fn: (...args: A) => R
): (...args: Parameters<typeof fn>) => void;
```

### Arguments

#### fn

A reference to a function you want to execute on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread) from the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread). Arguments to your function have to be passed to the function returned from `runOnUI` i.e. `runOnUI(myWorklet)(10);`.

### Returns

`runOnUI` returns a function that accepts arguments for the function passed as the first argument.

:::info
Don't forget to call the function returned from `runOnUI`.

## Example

import RunOnUI from '@site/src/examples/RunOnUI';
import RunOnUISrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/RunOnUI';

<InteractiveExample
  src={RunOnUISrc}
  component={<RunOnUI />}
  label="Tap each word"
/>

## Remarks

- When implementing your animations you should first reach for more general solutions such as [`useDerivedValue`](/docs/core/useDerivedValue), [`useAnimatedReaction`](/docs/advanced/useAnimatedReaction) or running code in gesture callbacks and only use `runOnUI` after you've tried other methods.

- It's a common mistake to execute function inside of runOnUI like this: ~~`runOnUI(myWorklet(10))()`~~. Here, the correct usage would be `runOnUI(myWorklet)(10)`.

- The callback passed as the argument is automatically [workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) and ready to be run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread).

- Make sure not to execute `runOnUI` on the UI thread as this will result in an error.
