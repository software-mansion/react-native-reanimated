# runOnJS

`runOnJS` lets you asynchronously run non-[workletized](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#to-workletize) functions that couldn't otherwise run on the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread). This applies to most external libraries as they don't have their functions marked with `"worklet";` directive.

`runOnJS` is usually used to update React state either on animation finish or conditionally within a gesture.

## Reference

```javascript
import { runOnJS } from 'react-native-reanimated';

function App() {
  // While on the UI thread
  runOnJS(navigation.goBack)();
}
```

<details>
<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function runOnJS<A extends any[], R>(
  fn: (...args: A) => R
): (...args: Parameters<typeof fn>) => void;
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### fn

A reference to a function you want to execute on the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread) from the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread). Arguments to your function have to be passed to the function returned from `runOnJS` i.e. `runOnJS(setValue)(10);`.

### Returns

`runOnJS` returns a function that accepts arguments for the function passed as the first argument. This function can be safely executed on the UI thread.

:::info
Don't forget to call the function returned from `runOnJS`.

## Example

import RunOnJS from '@site/src/examples/RunOnJS';
import RunOnJSSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/RunOnJS';

<InteractiveExample src={RunOnJSSrc} component={<RunOnJS />} />

## Remarks

- Functions passed to `runOnJS` must be defined in the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread) scope, i.e. in the component body or the global scope. This code won't work because `myFunction` is defined in the `withTiming` callback, which is only executed in the [UI thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#ui-thread):

<Indent>

```jsx
withTiming(0, {}, () => {
  // myFunction is defined on the UI thread
  const myFunction = () => {
    // ...
  };
  runOnJS(myFunction)(); // ðŸ’¥
});
```

</Indent>

- It's a common mistake to execute function inside of runOnJS like this: ~~`runOnJS(setValue(10))()`~~. Here, the correct usage would be `runOnJS(setValue)(10)`.

- It's safe to run functions via `runOnJS` on the [JavaScript thread](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#javascript-thread), as this has no effect.
