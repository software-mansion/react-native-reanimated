This tutorial will help you make your screens and components more smooth by adding animations.
We will use a new feature from the Reanimated library - Layout Animations which lets us animate:
* components appearance
* components disappearance
* layout changes

using predefined animations. There are plenty of predefined animations you can use, however, 
if you need to create more customized animation, you can easily implemented your own.

To give you a better understanding of how to use those animations, 
we are gonna prettify already existing screen - participant list, by adding layout animations to its components.
Here you can see, change that we will get after going through this tutorial.

<BeforeAndAfter before={Before} after={After}/>

<TutorialStep title="Screen Introduction">
    <div>
        Here we have already an existing Participant list component ( full code which you can easily copy and try for yourself you can find&nbsp;
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/jmysliv/87b15453aab173a63a4d22fcc5b1d603">
            here
        </a>&nbsp;).
        Let's focus on parts that we will animate, in this case - Participant component.
    </div>
    <FullCode/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Participant component">
    <div>
        Participant component is responsible for displaying a list item, which we will be animating.
    </div>
    <ParticipantComponent/>
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Participant component internals">
    <div>
        As you can see Participant component is wrapped in one View component, and that's the place where will be adding our animations.
        We can animate only components that are provided by reanimated ( e.g. Animated.View ), or components we changed using createAnimatedComponent.
    </div>
    <ParticipantInternals/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Step 1">
    <div>
        Let's import Animated from reanimated and replace View with Animated.View, so we can add animations to our component.
    </div>
    <Step1/>
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Step 2">
    <div>
        Now let's add an entering animation. We can choose entering animation from plenty of available&nbsp;
        <a href="https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/LayoutAnimations/entryAnimations">
            predefined animation.
        </a>
        &nbsp;We will go with LightSpeedInLeft effect.
    </div>
    <Step2/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Current result">
    <div>
       Here you can see, the effect we have achieved by adding entering animation.
    </div>
    <img src={Entering} style={{height: '500px', width: 'auto', borderRadius: "5%"}}/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Step 3">
    <div>
        Now let's add layout transition.
    </div>
    <Step3/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Current result">
    <div>
       Here you can see, the effect we have achieved by adding layout transition.
    </div>
    <img src={Layout} style={{height: '500px', width: 'auto', borderRadius: "5%"}}/>
    
</TutorialStep>
<TutorialStep title="Step 4">
    <div>
        Now let's add an exiting animation. We can choose exiting animation from plenty of available&nbsp;
        <a href="https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/LayoutAnimations/exitingAnimations">
            predefined animation.
        </a>
        &nbsp;We will go with LightSpeedOutRight effect.
    </div>
    <Step4/>
    
</TutorialStep>

#### And that's all! You can see that adding layout animations to our list was super easy and the user experience is way better. Full code of the animated list you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/jmysliv/0056d6cd3021883ea0f2c7f4af0526b2).
