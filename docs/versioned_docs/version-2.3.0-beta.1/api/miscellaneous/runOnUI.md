Enables executing worklet function on the UI thread. Note that UI execution is asynchronous from the callerâ€™s perspective. When you pass arguments, they will be copied to the UI JS context.

### Arguments

#### `fn` [function]

The first and the only argument is a worklet function that is supposed to be run.

### Returns

`runOnUI` returns a function which will be executed on UI thread.

## Example

```js {12}
import { runOnUI } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import React from 'react';

export default function App() {

    const someWorklet = (greeting) => {
        'worklet';
        console.log(greeting, 'From the UI thread');
    }

    const onPress = () => {
        runOnUI(someWorklet)('Howdy');
    }

  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="toggle"
        onPress={onPress}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```
