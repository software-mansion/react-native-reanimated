# Animating colors

Animating colors _feels_ like a separate case but in Reanimated colors are no different than animating any other value! In most cases you can simply use `withTiming` and `withSpring` to animate between colors. For more fine-gained control for more advances use cases Reanimated comes with `interpolateColor` which comes additional features like gamma and hue correction.
