## Marketing information

We may use your email address to send you information about our activities or events in which we think you may be interested, if you opt-in to receive such communication. You can opt-out at any time through your marketing preferences page by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing email you receive from us.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We may use common information-gathering tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels and other similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information as you navigate our websites, your account or when you interact with emails we send to you.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies allow us to identify your device as you navigate our websites or your account. This makes navigating and interacting with our websites or your account more efficient, easy and meaningful for you.
By themselves, cookies do not identify you specifically. Rather, they recognize your web browser. So, unless you identify yourself specifically to us, like signing into your account, we don’t know who you are just because you visited our website. We use persistent cookies. Session cookies are cookies that disappear from your computer or browser when you turn off your computer. Persistent cookies stay on your computer even after you’ve turned it off. These cookies enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility and are necessary for our websites to function properly.

## Where is your personal information stored?

Your personal data is collected and stored in accordance with Polish and EU laws.
In some cases, it may be necessary to share your data with other companies to perform services, such as website analytics providers. When we partner with such third parties, we enter into a contract that specifies the purpose of the data transfer and the operations to be performed. This ensures your rights as a user are respected and that we can apply maximum data protection efforts.
If we transfer information to a country or organization outside of the European Economic Area, we follow all applicable provisions to guarantee the protection and safety of your information.

## For how long do we keep personal data?

Your data will be processed only as long as there is a valid legal reason for doing so. This period may last from the moment your consent is granted until it is withdrawn or until any other action that restricts the processing of personal data.
If the data is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or our legitimate interests, it will be processed for the duration of the contract and then for an additional period until the statute of limitations expires. We will retain personal data as long as we have a legitimate interest in processing it, and this retention will continue until a valid objection is filed. The retention period will always comply with legal obligations, especially those related to taxation and accounting.
What are your rights as a data subject?
In accordance with the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), you have the following rights concerning your personal data that we process:

- The right to access your personal data and obtain a copy.
- The right to have your personal data corrected.
- The right to request the erasure of your data.
- The right to lodge a complaint with the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection.
- The right to restrict the processing of your data.
  If our processing of your data is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time. This withdrawal does not, however, affect the lawfulness of any processing that took place before the withdrawal.
  If your data is processed based on your consent or for the purpose of a contract, you also have the right to data portability.
  To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at legal@swmansion.com.
