# scheduleOnRuntimeWithId <AvailableFrom version="0.8.0"/>

`scheduleOnRuntimeWithId` is a variant of [scheduleOnRuntime](/docs/threading/scheduleOnRuntime) where you use the runtime's id instead of the runtime object. It's useful when you don't have access to the runtime object, but you know its id.

## Reference

```javascript
import { scheduleOnRuntimeWithId, createWorkletRuntime } from 'react-native-worklets';

const workletRuntime = createWorkletRuntime({ name: 'background' });

scheduleOnRuntimeWithId(workletRuntime.runtimeId, (greeting: string) => {
  console.log(`${greeting} from the background Worklet Runtime`);
}, 'Hello');
```

<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
function scheduleOnRuntimeWithId<Args extends unknown[], ReturnValue>(
  runtimeId: number,
  worklet: (...args: Args) => ReturnValue,
  ...args: Args
): void;
```

</details>

## Arguments

### runtimeId

The id of the [Worklet Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/runtimeKinds#worklet-runtime) to schedule the worklet on. You can get the id from the runtime object by accessing its `runtimeId` property.

### worklet

A reference to a function you want to execute on the [Worklet Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/runtimeKinds#worklet-runtime).

### args

Arguments to the function you want to execute on the [Worklet Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/runtimeKinds#worklet-runtime).

## Remarks

- The worklet is scheduled on the Worker Runtime's [Async
  Queue](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/blob/main/packages/react-native-worklets/Common/cpp/worklets/RunLoop/AsyncQueue.h)
- You can target the UI Runtime by passing [UIRuntimeID](/docs/threading/UIRuntimeID) as the runtime id.
- The worklet cannot be scheduled on the Worker Runtime from [UI
  Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/runtimeKinds#ui-runtime) or another [Worker
  Runtime](/docs/fundamentals/runtimeKinds#worker-runtime), unless the [Bundle Mode](/docs/bundleMode/) is enabled.

```javascript
import { createWorkletRuntime, scheduleOnRuntimeWithId } from 'react-native-worklets';

const workletRuntime = createWorkletRuntime({ name: 'background' });

runOnUI(() => {
  scheduleOnRuntimeWithId(workletRuntime.runtimeId, (greeting: string) => {
    console.log(`${greeting} from the background Worklet Runtime`);
  }, 'Hello'); // This will throw an error outside of Bundle Mode 🚨
});
```

```javascript
import { createWorkletRuntime, scheduleOnRuntimeWithId } from 'react-native-worklets';

const workletRuntime = createWorkletRuntime({ name: 'background' });
const anotherWorkletRuntime = createWorkletRuntime({ name: 'anotherBackground' });

scheduleOnRuntimeWithId(workletRuntime.runtimeId, () => {
  scheduleOnRuntimeWithId(anotherWorkletRuntime.runtimeId, (greeting: string) => {
    console.log(`${greeting} from the background Worklet Runtime`);
  }, 'Hello'); // This will throw an error outside of Bundle Mode 🚨
});
```
