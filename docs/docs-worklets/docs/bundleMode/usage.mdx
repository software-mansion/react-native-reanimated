# Usage

## Running third party libraries in Worklets

Third party libraries have to be on an allow-list to use them in worklets. This is because libraries can come with side-effects that would break a Worklet Runtime. For instance, a library that imports something from React Native can't be used on a Worklet Runtime. This would load a second instance of React Native and break your app.

To add a library to the allow-list you only need to set the `workletizableModules` option in Worklets Babel plugin, which is an array of library names. For instance, if you want to use `my-library` on a Worklet Runtime.

```javascript
/** @type {import('react-native-worklets/plugin').PluginOptions} */
const workletsPluginOptions = {
  bundleMode: true,
  // highlight-next-line
  workletizableModules: ['my-library'],
};
```

`workletizableModules` API is temporary and will be replaced with a more robust solution in the future.
