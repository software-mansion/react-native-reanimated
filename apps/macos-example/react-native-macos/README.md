> See the official [React Native website](https://reactnative.dev/) for an introduction to React Native.

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a framework developed by Facebook that enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere.

- **Declarative.** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based.** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Developer Velocity.** See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
- **Portability.** Reuse code across iOS, Android, and [other platforms][p].

React Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors. Find out more in our [ecosystem overview][e].

This repository is a working fork of **facebook/react-native** that adds support for the official React Native for macOS implementation from Microsoft.

You can read more about the macOS implementation in our website - [React Native for Windows + macOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/). You can read about how we manage this fork in our [docs](docs/) folder.

## üìã Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 13.4 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.dev) can be used to work around this.

## üéâ Building your first React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Trying out React Native][hello-world]
- [Creating a New Application][new-app]
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application][existing]

[hello-world]: https://snack.expo.dev/@samples/hello-world
[new-app]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
[existing]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps

## Requirements

You can run React Native for macOS apps on Mac devices with versions Catalina (10.15) or newer.

For a full and detailed list of the system requirements and how to set up your development platform, see our [System Requirements](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-dependencies) documentation on our website.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started) on our React Native for Windows + macOS website to build your first React Native for macOS app.

### Logging Issues

Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues) and try to make sure your problem doesn‚Äôt already exist before opening a new issue. If your issue doesn't exist yet, try to make sure you provide as much information as possible to us so we can help you sooner. It‚Äôs helpful if you include information like:

- The version of macOS, React Native, React Native macOS extension where you ran into the issue.
- A stack trace and reduced repro case when possible.
- Ensure the [appropriate template](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues/new/choose) is used when filing your issue(s).

## Contributing

See [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up your fork of the repo and start a PR to contribute to React Native for macOS.

[Good First Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [help wanted](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/labels/help%20wanted) are great starting points for PRs.

## Documentation

The full documentation for React Native can be found on the [documentation website][docs]. The React Native documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to React Native. For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the [React documentation][r-docs].

The source for the React Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, [**@facebook/react-native-website**][repo-website].

[React Native for Windows + macOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/) has its own separate documentation site where Windows and macOS
specific information, like API docs and blog updates live. We are still working on the documentation for macOS, contributions are welcome!

If you're looking for sample code, just browse the [RNTester folder](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/tree/master/packages/rn-tester) for examples
