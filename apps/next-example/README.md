## Running the NextExample app

You can:

- start the app in development mode:

```
yarn dev
```

- create and run a production build:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

- analyze the bundle with Next Bundle Analyzer. It will create a report and open it in your browser.

```
yarn build:analyze
```

- build the project without minification. This is useful when you want to manually review the created bundle.

```
yarn build:disable-minification
```
