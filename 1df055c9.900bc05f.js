elements of React Native architecture and helps with preventing frame drops in cases where JavaScript has some heavy work to do.\nUnfortunately this design does not play well when it comes to event driven interactions.\nWhen interacting with a touch screen, the user expects effects on screen to be immediate.\nIf updates are happening in a separate thread it is often a case that changes done in the JavaScript thread cannot be reflected in the same frame.\nIn React Native by default all updates are delayed by at least one frame as the communication between UI and JavaScript thread is asynchronous and UI thread never waits for the JavaScript thread to finish processing events.\nOn top of the lag with JavaScript playing many roles like running react diffing and updates, executing app\u2019s business logic, processing network requests, etc., it is often the case that events can\u2019t be immediately processed thus causing even more significant delays.\nReanimated aims to provide ways of offloading animation and event handling logic off of the JavaScript thread and onto the UI thread.\nThis is achieved by defining Reanimated worklets \u2013 a tiny chunks of JavaScript code that can be moved to a separate JavaScript VM and executed synchronously on the UI thread.\nThis makes it possible to respond to touch events immediately and update the UI within the same frame
